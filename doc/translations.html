    <h1>Neverball translation guidelines</h1>

    <h2>About this document</h2>

    <p>This document contains information for people who are interested in
    translating <a href="http://neverball.org/">Neverball</a> (and Neverputt)
    to their language of choice.</p>

    <p>If you have any questions after reading this document, do not hesitate
    to <a href="http://www.nevercorner.net/forum/" title="Neverforum">ask
        them</a>, so that this document can be further improved.</p>

    <h2>General information</h2>

    <p>Neverball is internationalised using the <a
        href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/">GNU Gettext
        internationalisation library</a>.  In this approach, translators
    typically work with PO files containing "message identifiers" (source text)
    and "message strings" (translations of the source text).</p>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <p>First, if there is already a translation for your language, contact the
    current translator (or translation team), as indicated in the respective PO
    file.  A list of current translations is available in the <a
        href="https://s.snth.net/projects/neverball/browser/trunk/po/">"po"
        subdirectory of the source code tree</a>.</p>

    <p>If your language does not yet have a translation, download the
    translation template file "neverball.pot".  Then, translate it.</p>

    <p>Important remarks:</p>

    <ul>

        <li>The text encoding must be UTF-8.</li>

        <li>Never edit the source text.  If you find errors or have any
        suggestions on how to improve the source text, please contact the
        developers (preferrably by posting a message on the forum).</li>

        <li>Some strings are "contextualised", in order to allow different
        translations for identical message identifiers.  These strings are in
        the form of "xxx^yyy", where "xxx" is the context and "yyy" is the
        string to translate.  The translations of such strings must have the
        context prefix removed and must <em>only</em> contain the translation
        of "yyy".</li>

    </ul>

    <p>After completing the translation, send us the translated file.  You can
    open a new thread in the forum and either link the PO file from there or
    send the file to one of the developers.</p>

    <h2>Tools</h2>

    <p>It is advisable to use a dedicated PO editing tool instead of editing
    the files manually.  By doing so, you will ensure that files remain in a
    valid format and encoding, and source text is not accidentally modified,
    and it will also minimise the time required for translation.</p>

    <p>Listed below are few of such editing tools.  There are also custom modes
    and plugins available for Vim and Emacs and probably your own favourite
    extensible text editor.</p>

    <dl>

        <dt>Poedit</dt>

        <dd><a href="http://www.poedit.net/">Poedit</a> is a multi-platform PO
        file editor.  If you are using Microsoft Windows, Poedit is likely to
        be your only option.  The interface is straigh-forward and the editor
        is easy-to-use.  It appears to lack documentation for key bindings,
        however, and plural forms for your language will have to be entered
        manually (if needed).</dd>

        <dt>KBabel</dt>

        <dd><a href="http://kbabel.kde.org/">KBabel</a> is an advanced PO
        editor for KDE.  It is so advanced, in fact, that this author gave up
        trying it out during the initial set-up...  Can be overwhelming and may
        require some time to become familiar with.</dd>

        <dt>gtranslator</dt>

        <dd><a href="http://gtranslator.sourceforge.net/">gtranslator</a> is a
        PO file editor for the GNOME desktop environment.  While being one of
        the easiest-to-use editors from those mentioned here, it unfortunately
        has a critical bug (up until version 1.1.7 as of this writing) and does
        not handle certain message identifiers correctly.  Therefore it is
        <strong>not usable with Neverball</strong> at the moment.</dd>

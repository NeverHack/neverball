#
# A simple makefile to compile Neverball, Neverputt and mapc Windows binaries,
# with mingw32.  You must have wine installed to compile maps.  You need to use
# a script which defines the variables of your Linux mingw32 cross-compilation
# environment (PATH, PREFIX, TARGET, CC, CXX, ...) to run this makefile. This
# scripts is usually named "cross-make.sh".  Currently you need to have SDL,
# SDL_ttf and SDL_image DLLs in the makefile directory to compile maps.

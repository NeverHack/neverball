                            * Neverball *


* COMPILATION

Requirements:

    SDL               http://www.libsdl.org/download-1.2.php
    SDL_image         http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/
    SDL_mixer         http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/
    SDL_ttf           http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/

Under Unix, Linux, and OSX, simply run

    make

Under Windows, build using the provided Visual Studio solution.

By default, an uninstalled build may be executed in place.


* INSTALLATION

The game  searches for game assets  in the following  three places, in
this order.  If the game is  to be installed globally, at least one of
them must be set.

 1. The directory specified as argument to '--data' (or '-d') option
    on the command line.

 2. The directory given by the NEVERBALL_DATA environment variable.

 3. The directory given by the CONFIG_DATA variable defined in
    base_config.h


A normal Linux installation would  probably copy the data directory to
"/usr/local/games/neverball/" and  change the CONFIG_DATA  variable to
match.

A  normal  Windows installation  would  simply  copy  the entire  game
directory  to "C:\Program Files\Neverball"  and leave  the CONFIG_DATA
variable to its default value "./data".


* DISTRIBUTION

The dist directory contains some miscellaneous files:

  * manual pages;
  * .desktop files;
  * icons.

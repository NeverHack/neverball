                            * Neverball *


* REQUIREMENTS

    SDL               http://www.libsdl.org/download-1.2.php
    SDL_ttf           http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/
    libvorbis         http://xiph.org/vorbis/
    libpng            http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html
    libjpeg

To build Neverball  with native language support on  systems not using
the GNU C library, two additonal libraries may have to be installed:

    libintl           http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/
    libiconv          http://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/

To  build Neverball  with Nintendo  Wii Remote  support on  Linux, the
"official Linux Bluetooth protocol stack"  or BlueZ and the libwiimote
library must be installed and configured:

    BlueZ             http://www.bluez.org/
    libwiimote        http://libwiimote.sourceforge.net/


* COMPILATION

Under Unix and Linux, simply run

    make

Certain features  can be enabled/disabled  at compile time  by passing
additional arguments to  Make in the form "NAME=VALUE",  where NAME is
one of those listed below and VALUE is typically 0 for disabled, 1 for
enabled.

    ENABLE_NLS

        Enable  native   language  support.  May   require  additional
        libraries. Default: enabled.

    ENABLE_WII

        Enable Wii  Remote support. Requires additional  libraries and
        system configuration Default: disabled .

Under Mac OS X, build using the provided Xcode project files.

For  Windows  builds,  the   MinGW  cross-compilation  environment  is
supported. (Native  builds are theoretically possible  using MinGW and
MSYS. Although care  is taken to preserve compatibility  with MSYS, no
support exists and no actual testing is done.)

By default, an uninstalled build may be executed in place.


* INSTALLATION

The game  searches for game assets  in the following  three places, in
this order.  If the game is  to be installed globally, at least one of
them must be set.

 1. The directory  specified as argument to '--data'  (or '-d') option
    on the command line.

 2. The directory given by the NEVERBALL_DATA environment variable.

 3. The   directory   given  by  the  CONFIG_DATA   macro  defined  in
    share/base_config.h

A normal Linux installation would  probably copy the data directory to
"/usr/local/share/games/neverball/" and  change the  CONFIG_DATA macro
to match.


* DISTRIBUTION

The dist subdirectory contains some miscellaneous files:

  * "Desktop entry" or .desktop files.
  * Icons in PNG, SVG and ICO formats.

This file contains some information for people who are interested in
translating Neverball and Neverputt in their language of choice.

This file is mostly a reformatted version of Jean's post on the forum.
See http://www.nevercorner.net/forum/viewtopic.php?id=422 (the info
here is probably more up-to-date, though).

----------------------------------------------------------------------

First, if there is already a translation for your language, contact
the current translator.  A list of current translations is available
at:

    https://s.snth.net/projects/neverball/browser/trunk/po/

If your language does not yet have a translation, download the
following file:

    https://s.snth.net/projects/neverball/file/trunk/po/neverball.pot?format=raw

Second, translate it.  Translation is quite easy:  each "msgid"
corresponds to a string in English, and each "msgstr" corresponds to
your translation.

Some important remarks:

  - The encoding must be UTF-8.

  - Never edit an English string.  If you think that some English
    strings are bogus, please write a small bug report (or post a
    message on the forum if you're lazy).

  - Some strings are contextualized.  They are in the form of
    "xxx^yyy", where "xxx" is the context and "yyy" is the string to
    translate.  "msgstr" should only contain the translation of "yyy"
    without the "xxx^" prefix.

Third, send us the translated file.  You can either send the
translation directly to rlk <robert.kooima@gmail.com> or open a new
thread in the forum dedicated to translation in your language and link
the translation from there.

If you have any questions at this point, do not hesitate to ask them,
so that this document can be further improved.
